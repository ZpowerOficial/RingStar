# RingStar

This repository contains a lightweight football career simulator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game saves progress locally in your browser and can optionally be connected to your own Firebase project.

## Playing

1. Open `app/index.html` in a modern browser. You can double-click the file or serve the `app` directory locally with a static server (for example `npx serve app`).
2. Edit `app/main.js` and replace the placeholder values inside `firebaseConfig` if you want to integrate Firebase authentication and storage.
3. Create your player, advance seasons and follow the timeline of events.

Have fun guiding a rookie to stardom!
